you need to pass some arguments in here.
**filename** is the picture that you want to modified
**file_output** is the name of output picture
**times_of_repetition** is the total times of filter using gaussian blur (3x3)

you need to pass some arguments in here.
**filename** is the picture that you want to modified
**file_output** is the name of output picture
**times_of_repetition** is the total times of filter using median
**size_of_the_blur** is the size of filter (size_of_the_blur x size_of_the_blur) expected in odd number and greater than 0
